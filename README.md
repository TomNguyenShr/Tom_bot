# This is Tom bot
To use this is very simple, first let the bot join you with the command 1join, then say "play (your song)" after that the bot should play the song that u have asked it to play, to add new song just use the command !play

# How does this bot work?
First off, it uses discord.js to access discord. Then it uses discord-text-to-speech to tranform speech to text, then use distube to search for your requested songs.

#HAVE FUN!
